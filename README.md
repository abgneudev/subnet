## Features

## Prerequisites

To get started with development, you need to have the following:

- A Subconscious API Key

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary values.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

## Getting Started With Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run database migrations
pnpm db:migrate

# Seed the database with sample agents (we have a few agents to get you started)
pnpm db:seed

# Start the development server
pnpm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the application.
